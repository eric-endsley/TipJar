# TipJar

## Description 

Welcome to the TipJar repo. This is my capstone project for Epicodus. This is a new type of mobile payment app, built in React Native using Expo. TipJar will allow artists, performers, event organizers or business owners to create hands free TipJars for events which allow the public to semi-anonymously contribute funds which will pay out to registered users associated with the TipJar. For example, musicians playing a show could register and associate themselves with a single TipJar. At the conclusion of the event, this TipJar would automate the process of evenly distributing the tips between the associated users. 

Streamlining this process will make it easier for performers to collect funds, and easier for the public to support acts and events that they enjoy. Bars and venues could even use TipJar to collect cover charge, eliminating the need to stop at the ATM before heading to a show.
