TipJar


##### Description

I want to develop a mobile payment app (or ideally, an application which integrates other existing payment apps/technologies) which allows users to easily set up a pooled digital ‘tipjar’ which can be linked to multiple user accounts for paying out to, and can easily be paid into by any user who is registered with the service (or ideally, who is registered with another service i.e., you can pay into the tipjar with your Google Pay and you don’t even have to sign up for this service unless you are collected tip).


##### Use Case

The main use case for this in my mind (just because I have experience in this situation) would be local bands playing small time gigs or house shows. In a cashless world it’s very difficult to collect door charge at a house show, or to get any significant amount of money paid into a physical tip jar for voluntary donations to performers. I find that this is generally not because are unwilling or uninterested in supporting the artists, but because they don’t carry physical cash, and it becomes a mess to try to pay into something like a venmo account and then distribute it outwards. Any other type of performer could likely take advantage of this application, as well as other groups collecting semi-anonymous donations. 

This application would hopefully streamline the process of ‘various semi-anonymous users pay into a digital cash pool, a few registered users distribute this pool amongst themselves’. 


##### Minimum Viable Product

A mobile application that runs on Android, looks clean and professional

Mobile application allows users to register as tip collectors 

Mobile application allows registered users to set up TipJars for events which will off detail pages where tipping functionality would go

##### Tools for MVP

React Native

Firebase

Expo

##### Additional Features

Mobile application allows multiple registered users to link their accounts to the TipJar, signifying they will be payees of the event

Allow payment functionality - registered or unregistered users can contribute to an event's tipjar

Integrate an existing payment technology for payment functionality (e.g. users can pay in with Google Pay, don't have to provide any banking information to the app themselves)

Allowing custom payment distributions out of the tipjar (e.g. the headliner gets more pay), or allowing registered performers to ‘pass their payment on to the touring band (which is a common courtesy)’ with a single button.

Animations

##### Tools for Additional Features

Stripe API, Plaid API, Google Pay API (or something like it). This part will still need a lot of research to see what's ideal & what's feasible. 


##### Additional Information

I’m still pretty fuzzy on what it’s going to take to get this project done. I am prepared to accept merely a skeletal mobile application that runs and allows registration and the skeleton to create 'tipjars' if that is all I am able to achieve. I really do see this project as solving a novel use case, an application that I actually would use in my life as a musician, so this is something I would gladly poke away at as a pet project.
